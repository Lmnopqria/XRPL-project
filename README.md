#  Xsolace â€“ Transparent Disater Relief via XRP Token on XRP Ledger

> A transparent earthquake donation platform using RLUSD stablecoin on the XRP Ledger to deliver instant, auditable aid.


##  Problem

Earthquake victims often suffer from delayed and opaque relief distribution. Traditional donation systems include intermediaries, high fees, and lack public accountability.


##  Solution

**Xsolace** leverages the XRP Ledger and XRP Token to:
- Enable instant, low-cost donations to verified recipients and NGOs.
- Ensure transparency by recording all transactions on-chain.
- Tag donations with clear metadata (memo fields) for traceability.

---

##  How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet** (XRP-compatible wallet via XUMM or client wallet)
2. **Trust XRP Issuer** (trustline established)
3. **Donate XRP** â€“ choose amount, add optional memo
4. **View Public Ledger** â€“ every donation is verifiable via transaction hash
